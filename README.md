## 🩸 What I Deliver

- **Platforms that print revenue:** engineered for viral scale, not demo day.  
- **Codebases that age gracefully:** modular, documented, ESLint-perfect, TS-clean.  
- **Workflows that vanish bottlenecks:** automation so sharp it feels like sorcery.  
- **Launches that stick the landing:** zero-downtime releases and bulletproof rollbacks.

> I don’t “push commits.” I weaponize ideas.
